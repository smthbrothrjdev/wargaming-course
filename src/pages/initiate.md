## Develop Relationship with sponsor

## Form Core Wargaming Team

## Determine Sponsor's Objective and Issues

### Problem Definition
 You must get the **Objective** and **Issues** right. This is why getting the sponsor directly is a good idea. Using an intermediary can cause problems

#### 3 Golden Interactions
1. Listen. Ask clarifying quesitons. Goal is to understand the problem. (12 hours)
2. Backbrief. "Here is what I believe is what you asked for". Validate your understanding problem.
3. Set the table for what you will try to do. Scope the problem for a single wargaming and time. Get agreement.

## Data collection and Management Plan
### Essential QUestions
- Sponsor issues -> sub issues -> sub issues || Essential Questions
- number in uml req modeling format (1.1.1)
- help determine if problem is too large

### Methods, models, and tools
- how do we simulate the wargame to answer the EQ (dice, token, seminar, computer game simulation)

### Personnel selection
- who are the players (who represents force x)
- data collection team needs to be included in the player list.
- provide them with context read ahead.
    - objectives
    - provide motivation for friction/ competition.
