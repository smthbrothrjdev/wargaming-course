# Sponsor Briefback: EFDL Wargame CLA Overview

## Objective
Identify how integration of sensors, uncrewed systems, and AI-enabled C2 can counter adversary force overmatch in a high-intensity conflict scenario on NATO’s eastern flank.

## Key Issues
- What AI and network architectures enable rapid targeting and coordination?
- How should operational fires be employed to blunt adversary mass and delay follow-on forces?
- What doctrinal or interoperability gaps limit effectiveness?
- How can resilience be ensured in degraded or denied environments?

## Assumptions
- Scenario is based on near-future capabilities (1–3 years).
- Friendly forces represent scaled-down brigade (battalion-equivalent).
- Enemy maintains 3:1 numerical overmatch across engagements.
- EW, drone, AI systems will be modeled based on open-source estimations.
- No WMD use is assumed.
- Network connectivity is functional (85% uptime).

## Constraints
- 3:1 force ratio must be preserved.
- Must include drones, AI, and networked C2 elements.
- Scenario location and conventional warfare context are fixed.
- Design must stay unclassified.

## Limitations
- Only two days and four staff available for design.
- No classified or SME-sourced technical details.
- Focus must be placed on C2 and fires; logistics assumed non-limiting.
