# Golden Interaction 2 Backbrief - Eastern Flank Deterrence Line (EFDL)

## Sponsor's Objective and Context

The sponsor's core objective is to **assess the effectiveness of the Eastern Flank Deterrence Line (EFDL) concept** in a near-future conflict scenario. In plain terms, this means evaluating whether a NATO force, employing **layered defenses** and advanced new capabilities, can **expel Russian forces from allied territory within a 21-day campaign**. The EFDL concept is a NATO strategy to create a **unified, data-driven defense infrastructure** across the Eastern Flank. It links allied units with shared sensors, integrated fires, and rapid data-sharing to counter Russian aggression.

The sponsor specifically highlights new technologies **counter-drone measures, "attritable" uncrewed systems, AI-enabled targeting, and sensor fusion** as key enablers. These must be fielded no later than December 2027. These capabilities, combined with layered defensive operations, are expected to improve NATO's responsiveness and effectiveness.

**Sponsor's Objective (Reframed):** _Determine if NATO's EFDL concept, using multi-layered defenses and emerging technologies (counter-UAS, expendable drones, AI-driven targeting, fused sensor networks), can halt and reverse a Russian incursion within 21 days by 2028._ Identify which new systems and force constructs are critical to achieving that outcome.

## Key Assumptions & Constraints

- **Technological Readiness by 2027:** All new capabilities (counter-drone, attritable UxS, AI, sensor fusion) are fielded by December 2027. The game does not debate if they exist, only how to employ them.
- **Conventional Conflict Scope:** The scenario envisions a high-intensity conflict on NATO’s eastern flank. No escalation to strategic nuclear or chemical weapons.
- **Russian Threat Profile:** Russian forces are expected to use tactics seen in recent wars. This includes mass drone and missile attacks. Counter-UAS and cost-effective interceptors are a priority.
- **Layered Defense Concept:** NATO uses multiple defensive echelons. These include integrated air and missile defenses, long-range fires, and maneuver units. All are connected by data-sharing and C2.
- **Coalition Interoperability:** NATO operates under a unified command. Communications and data links are compatible. Political cohesion and data sharing are assumed.
- **21-Day Campaign Limit:** NATO must expel Russian forces within 21 days. This is a hard limit based on planning factors and strategic factors. The wargame must evaluate if it is feasible.

These assumptions are constraints for the wargame design. The next step is defining the problem using structured issues and questions.

## Key Issues and Structured Sub-Issues

### Issue 1: **Optimal Capabilities for the NATO Maneuver Brigade**

**Reframed Issue:** _What combination of existing and emerging combat capabilities should a NATO maneuver brigade include to maximize effectiveness under the EFDL concept?_ We must identify how to equip and organize the brigade by blending current systems with new technologies.

#### 1.1 Critical Existing Capabilities

- **1.1.1**: Which **ground maneuver platforms** (e.g. tanks, IFVs) are essential to fight and survive?
- **1.1.2**: Which **fires and air defense assets** (e.g. howitzers, SHORAD) are critical to support and protect the brigade?
- **1.1.3**: What **C2 and communications systems** are required to integrate with EFDL networks?
- **1.1.4**: What type of operations are going to be effective in support of EFDL

#### 1.2 Integration of Emerging Technologies

- **1.2.1**: Add **counter-UAS teams or platforms** to the brigade. Assess short-range anti-drone systems (e.g. jammers, lasers, intercept drones).
- **1.2.2**: Include **attritable uncrewed platforms** (e.g. expendable drones or UGVs) for ISR, decoys, or fires.
- **1.2.3**: Employ **AI targeting and sensor fusion** tools to link sensors and shooters across the force.

#### 1.3 Organizational Adaptations

- **1.3.1**: Does the brigade need different unit structures such as a multi-domain concept (e.g. drone company, cyber or EW platoons)?
- **1.3.2**: How should doctrine and training change to combine traditional and new capabilities?
- **1.3.3**: How should Tactics, Techniques, And Procudres (TTPs) be adapted in response to changing enemy tactics and strategy.

**Essential Question 1:** **What is the optimal mix of current assets and new technologies for a NATO maneuver brigade to successfully execute the EFDL mission and expel a Russian force in 21 days?**

### Issue 2: **Integrating a Counter-Drone Network (Sensors & Shooters)**

**Reframed Issue:** _How should NATO integrate sensors and shooters into a counter-drone network across the EFDL? What systems are required?_

#### 2.1 Sensor Layer Requirements

- **2.1.1**: What **ground-based radars** are needed to detect small UAS and cruise missiles?
- **2.1.2**: What **passive detection systems** (e.g. RF, optical, acoustic) supplement radar and work in EMCON?
- **2.1.3**: How should sensors be placed and protected? Are **attritable distributed sensor networks** feasible?

#### 2.2 Shooter Layer Requirements

- **2.2.1**: What **kinetic interceptors** (e.g. missiles, guns) can defeat a range of aerial threats?
- **2.2.2**: What **non-kinetic systems** (e.g. lasers, EW) can defeat swarms at lower cost?
- **2.2.3**: Can **drone-on-drone interceptors** or loitering munitions counter UAS threats effectively?

#### 2.3 Integration & Battle Management

- **2.3.1**: What **network architecture** will link NATO sensors and shooters in real time?
- **2.3.2**: What **AI battle management systems** will automate sensor fusion and weapon cueing?
- **2.3.3**: What **interoperability rules and ROE** enable multinational coordination and engagement at scale?
- **2.3.4**: How does introduction of new capabilities integrate into existing C2 and orgazational Battle Management infrastucture. 

**Essential Question 2:** **How can NATO effectively integrate a network of sensors and shooters to counter mass drone attacks and other aerial threats under the EFDL concept?**

### Issue 3: **Operational Fires Command - Capabilities Integration**

**Reframed Issue:** _What capabilities must the Operational Fires Command (OFC), including UAS regiments, integrate and manage for NATO to succeed in this scenario?_
