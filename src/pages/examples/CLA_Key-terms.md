# CLA and Key Terms 

## 1. Constraints(

**C1. Enemy 3:1 Force Overmatch**  
Sponsor requires that adversary forces maintain a 3:1 numerical advantage across engagements.  
**Assumption A1.1:** Friendly forces will be modeled at reduced echelon ( brigade ) to maintain consistency with this constraint.

**C2. Use of Uncrewed Systems & AI-Enabled Networked C2**  
Sponsor mandates the inclusion of drones, robotic systems, and automated battle management to reflect core aspects of the EFDL concept.  
**Assumption A2.1:** Blue forces will possess and employ AI-supported targeting tools and a heterogeneous suite of low-cost uncrewed systems (UAS, loitering munitions).

**C3. Scenario Scope: Fixed Geographic and Strategic Context**  
The wargame must take place within the NATO eastern flank in a near-future conflict. WMDs are not expected or planned for.  
**Assumption A3.1:** This is a conventional peer conflict with no WMD employment.

**C4. Time Available for Development**  
The design team has two days and four personnel to structure analytic outputs.  
**Assumption A4.1:** Depth and complexity of outputs will be limited and analytic focus must be narrowed accordingly.

**C5. Classification Boundary**  
All materials must remain unclassified.  
**Assumption A5.1:** System performance data and adversary capabilities will be derived from open sources or generalized proxies.

## 2. Limitations

**L1. Limited Design Time and Personnel**  
Only 2 days and 4 staff are available for design and analytic preparation.  
**Assumption A1.1:** Full decomposition of issues and deep modeling of systems will not be feasible; focus will be placed on essential elements.

**L2. Limited Access to SME Knowledge and Detailed Operational Doctrine**  
No access to classified assessments or embedded SMEs.  
**Assumption A2.1:** System performance and employment concepts will be approximated using open-source data and doctrinal analogs.  
**Assumption A2.2:** Threat actions, counter-UAS behavior, and operational tactics will reflect generalized adversary doctrine.

**L3. Lack of Detailed Technical System Data**  
Specific performance data on EW, AI systems, or novel UAS types is not available.  
**Assumption A3.1:** Operational effects of emerging technologies (e.g. drone swarm attrition rates) will be modeled using notional capabilities.

**L4. Analytic Breadth vs. Depth Tradeoff**  
Given the broad scope across technological, tactical, and operational dimensions, the team cannot fully explore all questions in depth.  
**Assumption A4.1:** Emphasis will be placed on C2 integration, force coordination, and impact on tempo over sustainment or logistics.  
**Assumption A4.2:** Logistics effects are considered off-table and assumed to be non-limiting for the duration of the scenario.

**L5. Need to Operate in an Unclassified Analytic Space**  
Sensitive capabilities, especially for EW and AI, cannot be fully represented.  
**Assumption A5.1:** All data, threat behaviors, and effects modeling will be abstracted or genericized for unclassified discussion.

## 3. Key Terms and Definitions 

**Maximum Effectiveness**  
Achieving a degradation in adversary combat capability no less than 65% of initial effective strength (personnel, materiel, and command function). Used to denote decisive results.

**Scalable Network**  
A secure, resilient communications and data-sharing infrastructure that maintains operability when expanding to new nodes or geographic areas.  
**Assumption:** Network availability exceeds 85% uptime across the battlespace.

**AI Battle Management**  
Automated support tools for cueing fires, recommending targets, and maintaining situational awareness.  
**Assumption:** AI tools are functional and useful, but not autonomous; all decisions remain human-approved.

**Operational Fires**  
Long-range precision or area fires employed against adversary depth targets (e.g., reserve formations, command nodes, logistics corridors).  
**Assumption:** Fires effects are resolved within the operational timeframe (~24–72 hours) and are synchronized with frontline maneuver.

**Attritable Systems**  
Low-cost, uncrewed systems designed to be expendable in achieving mission effects.  
**Assumption:** Friendly UAS, EW drones, and loitering munitions are deployed in sufficient quantity to allow iterative losses without strategic degradation.

**Mass and Momentum (Adversary)**  
Enemy ability to surge forward multi-battalion formations and maintain a continuous attack cycle.  
**Constraint:** The adversary must maintain a 3:1 overmatch across the scenario timeframe.

- 2.3: What rules, ROE, and common operating frameworks enable multinational employment of integrated systems?
- 2.4: What resilience measures mitigate denial, jamming, or partial network collapse?

### Key Issue 3: Operational Fires Command Capabilities
What systems and command structures must be integrated to deliver timely deep fires against enemy mass and depth?
- 3.1: What long-range assets and platforms are needed?
- 3.2: How can coordination between maneuver and fires units be optimized?
